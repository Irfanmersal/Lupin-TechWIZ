The model aims to address the issue of young people dying from heart-related problems during physical activities.

 The task involves creating a machine learning model to predict triglyceride levels based on various features such as age, gender, height, weight, eye power, hearing ability, blood pressure, glucose level, cholesterol levels, smoking and drinking habits, residential area, and creatinine and liver enzyme levels. The model aims to address the issue of young people dying from heart-related problems during physical activities. The evaluation metric is Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the submission file must be in .csv format with the index as candidate_id and the target as triglyceride_lvl column. The dataset includes train.csv (22400 x 24), test.csv (9600 x 23), and sample_submission.csv (5 x 2). The user needs to develop a model that can effectively predict triglyceride levels and submit the results in the specified format.
Key Points:
- Create a machine learning model to predict triglyceride levels based on various features.
- Use the provided dataset with train.csv, test.csv, and sample_submission.csv.
- The evaluation metric for the model is Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- Submission file must be in .csv format with the index as candidate_id and the target as triglyceride_lvl column.
- Aim to address the issue of young people dying from heart-related problems during physical activities.
